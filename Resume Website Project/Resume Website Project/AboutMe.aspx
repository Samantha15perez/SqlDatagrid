    <h1>About Me</h1><h5> My name is Samantha Perez, and I&#39;m a novice programmer from south Florida. When I&#39;m not riding my alligator through the orange groves on my way to disney world, I code and animate in my free time between work and school. </h5><h5> I graduated from West Port High School, and I am currently enrolled in Marion Technical College in Database Application and Programming. I hope to take advantage of every opportunity this class throws at me in order to learn and eventually propel myself forward into a worthwhile career. I currently work as an OTP2 (Operations Technology Person, rank 2) for Pacific Arches, under the Mcdonalds Corporation, doing self-employed digital art, graphic design, and electronic repair on the side. </h5><h5> My phrase for every situation tends to be &quot;Hakuna matata&quot;, as I pride myself in being a fairly laid back person, as you never really know what life&#39;s about to throw at you. That being said, I am determined to push forward in life and be 
    a positive driving force in this world. </h5>
